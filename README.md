# ML-Zoomcamp-Capstone2-BitCoinPricePrediction
## Welcome
The main goal of this Capstone Project is to make a model for detecting skin cancer and set up the system for using it. I'll be using two pre-trained Keras applications, Xception and EfficientNet, without the top layers, to create three different models. Because of limited time and the limited free computing power available in Colab, I didn't try making more models or systems and I was not able to experiment with the done models as much as I would like. After checking, the best results I got a 0.71 accuracy on the validation dataset. This is far from the standards for detecting skin cancer in the industry, so, the model needs more work to usable in the medical field and only has a educative perspective. I will work beyond this course to make a model that works addecually. 

This project was devided into the following parts:
1. Why Skin Cancer Detection?
2. Dataset Employed
3. Models Differences
4. Models Optimization

## Why Skin Cancer Detection?
Skin cancer emerges as one of the rapidly proliferating diseases worldwide. It involves the uncontrolled development of abnormal skin cells. Detecting and diagnosing the disease early are crucial steps in identifying potential cancer therapies
[1].
The present challenge associated with manual identification performed by skilled medical professionals is its susceptibility to variation based on experience in the field. Even in the case of experts, there is a potential for mislabeling. For instance, the accuracy in diagnosing basal cell carcinoma (BCC), indicated by the higher positive predictive value (PPV), stands at 72.7% [2].
The application of AI models has proven to be an invaluable tool for skin cancer identification. This technology enables individuals with smartphones to achieve accuracies comparable to or surpassing those of trained experts [3].

  As this model results were not an improvement from Xception similar model, and as the training time for this model is too high, the model was discarded because of computation limitations at the moment

### Selected Model
The model 1.5 was selected for further work as is the simpliest one with higher accuracy

## Script for using the model
1. Clone this repository into your local machine
2. Install the needed dependencies with  ```!pip install keras-image-helper ``` ``` !pip install --extra-index-url https://google-coral.github.io/py-repo/ tflite_runtime ```
3. Open your command shell
4. Go to the directory where the cloned repositore was stored
5. Open the folder "Separate Script"
6. Open the file tensorflow_model_cs1.py and change the "url" variable to set it to the URL of the image that you would like to test case save it
7. Run the file using ``` python tensorflow_model_cs1.py ```

## Containerized model for use with AWS Lambda
To work with the selected model, you can use the image prepared to be used with AWS Lambda. To test the image you shoudl follow the follwing steps:
1. Clone this repository into your local machine
2. Open your command shell
3. Go to the directory where the cloned repositore was stored
4. Open the folder "Serverles"
5. Be sure that Docker is working in your system and type ``` docker build -t scd:001 . ```
6. Once the build is ready, type  c docker run -p 8080:8080 scd:001 ```
7. Open another terminal on the folder "Serverles"
8. Now type ``` python test.py ```

You should be able to get the console run following this steps. You can open the file test.py with an editor and chage the URL in line 5 to test differente images
